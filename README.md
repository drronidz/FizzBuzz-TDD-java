# FizzBuzz Test Driven Development - Java
**Fizz Buzz** is a group word game for children to teach them about division.

Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz",
and any number divisible by five with the word **"buzz"**.


We need to write a program that returns integers between 1 & 100.

We need to consider :
- For the multiples of 3, we replace the number by **"Fizz"**.
- For the multiples of 5, we replace the number by **"Buzz"**.
- For the multiples of 15, we replace the number by **"FizzBuzz"**.

Example:
"12Fizz4BuzzFizz78FizzBuzz............................Buzz"
